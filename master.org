   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The goal is to implement real-time collaborative editing in Emacs. 
   #+END_QUOTE

   Collaborative editing is a form of groupware

   We will focus on developing a sound protocol for real-time collaboration,
   which is to be minimal, and optimized for software development. To
   determine whether or not the protocol is sound, we want model it, and
   verify it using a tool for model checking.

   # In order to achieve this we want to describe the problem formally.
